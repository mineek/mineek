## Mineek
hi. I'm a developer (maybe) who loves to mess around with software and experiment with putting things on things they're not supposed to be on

## Support Me
Everything I do is for free, and open source. If you like my work, please consider supporting me on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/mineekdev), it would help me stay motivated and help me buy new testing devices for example. Thanks.
